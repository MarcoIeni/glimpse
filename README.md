# Glimpse

Still experimental. Not ready for use.
Come back later. ðŸ‘€

## Features

- you can use the arrow keys to navigate the menu

TODO: Describe specific features of your extension including screenshots of your extension in action.

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

## Extension Settings

Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `myExtension.enable`: Enable/disable this extension.
* `myExtension.thing`: Set to `blah` to do something.

## Plan

- configuration in javascript/typescript. I.e. you import our library with our key bindings and you can edit them in plain javascript. Not in json.
