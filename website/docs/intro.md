# Introduction

Glimpse is a VSCode extension that helps you run VSCode commands with easy-to-remember key bindings.

Glimpse doesn't require you to memorize key bindings. Instead, it shows you the available key bindings as you type.
E.g. when pressing `<glimpse_leader> f`, Glimpse shows you all the key bindings related to files.

Assuming `<glimpse_leader>` is `space`, you can press `space f d` to delete the current file.
